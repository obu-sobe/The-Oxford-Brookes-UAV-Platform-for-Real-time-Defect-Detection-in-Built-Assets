The Sstructural health monitoring (SHM) for of buildings engineering structure, is a crucial task which requires continuous monitoring of the physical properties of the asset to obtain actionable and quantitative information about the structure over time. Traditional SHM techniques, however, are tedious and depend on manual labour. The inspection of unsafe environment can also be ineffective and may lead to miss-judgement of the severity of the damage.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76107657/118622325-1aba8500-b7bf-11eb-9169-dc92043dabb4.png)
