# UAV-Platform-for-Real-time-Damage-Detection
The Sstructural health monitoring (SHM) for of buildings engineering structure, is a crucial task which requires continuous monitoring of the physical properties of the asset to obtain actionable and quantitative information about the structure over time. Traditional SHM techniques, however, are tedious and depend on manual labour. The inspection of unsafe environment can also be ineffective and may lead to miss-judgement of the severity of the damage.

This work is devoted to the development of a deep learning-based drone system suitable for real-time detection of structure damages. The drone system is equipped with an on-broad single board computer and a high definition camera. The on-board computer transmits real-time videos captured by the drone camera over WIFI connection to a GPU-based ground station running a deep-learning neural network for damages detection. This application can offer a practical, effective and low-cost solution for condition assessment procedures of structural systems.
